# ðŸš€ Quick Migration Setup Guide

## âš¡ **Step 1: Get Your Railway URL**

1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Click "Generate Domain" if you haven't already
3. Copy your Railway URL (looks like: `https://hitbullseye-quiz-backend-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`)

## âš¡ **Step 2: Update Migration Scripts**

Replace `https://hitbullseye-quiz-backend-production-XXXX.up.railway.app` with your actual Railway URL in these files:

- `migrate-users.js` (line 15)
- `migrate-questions.js` (line 15)

## âš¡ **Step 3: Run Migration**

### Option A: Run All at Once (Recommended)
```bash
cd ExtensionBackend/server
node migrate-all.js
```

### Option B: Run Individually
```bash
# First migrate users
node migrate-users.js

# Then migrate questions (after users are successful)
node migrate-questions.js
```

## ðŸ“Š **What You'll See**

### Users Migration (7 users):
```

After migration, verify in MongoDB Atlas:
1. Go to MongoDB Atlas â†’ Collections
2. Check `users` collection (should have 7 documents)
3. Check `questions` collection (should have ~911 documents)

## ðŸ§ª **Test API**

Test with your Railway URL:
```bash
# Test health
curl https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health

# Test user verification
curl -X POST https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/auth/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"AccessKey": "1222262587654321"}'
```

After successful migration:
- âœ… All 7 users in MongoDB Atlas
- âœ… All ~911 questions in MongoDB Atlas
- âœ… Chrome extension ready for live API
- âœ… System fully cloud-based
